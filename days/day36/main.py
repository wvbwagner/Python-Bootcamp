    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 7. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
news_list = [f"HeadLine: {article.get('title')}. \nBrief: {article.get('description')}" for article in top_three]
